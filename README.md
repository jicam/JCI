DO NOT DESPAIR... GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME, AND I WILL ORGANIZE THIS GITHUB REPOSITORY IN A MORE 'CONSTRUCTIVE' WAY.

Iâ€™m thinking of including:

1- Some C++ programs controlling the ESP32 and displaying static or rotating images. 
2- All the available drawings ready to be displayed on an analog oscilloscope screen. 
3- Python programs for converting DXF files into text files.
